Knowledge Based Artificial Intelligence Projects
=============

### I Built an AI agent which can solve Ravens Progressive Matrix problem using concepts such as Frames, Case-Based Reasoning and Means-Ends Analysis.

Raven’s Progressive Matrices (RPM) is a non-verbal intelligence test. RPM tests the reasoning ability of humans. The questions do not contain words and are not constrained to any language-groups. The questions are purely image oriented and are supposed to be solved by visual analogy. The questions generally contain 2×2 or 3×3 matrices with one matrix element to be filled by the test taker from the list of choices given.

This was a semester long project and involved three design iterations. The 1st iteration (Project 1) involved designing an agent that takes in verbal input and solves 2x2 matrices.  Project 2 involved 3x3 matrices.  Project 3 involved solving 3x3 matrices using Visual Representations.  


### To run project:

run RavensProject.py

Default is running project 3.

To run projects 1 or 2, copy and replace Agent.py in main directory from Project 1 or Project 2 folders
